# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-SpaceX

### Introduction

    In this capstone, our objective is to predict the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage. SpaceX showcases Falcon 9 rocket launches on their website, priced at $62 million, a significant contrast to other providers' costs of $165 million or more per launch. Much of this cost disparity arises from SpaceX's ability to recycle the first stage. Thus, discerning the first stage's landing outcome holds the key to estimating launch expenses. Such insights prove valuable when alternative companies vie against SpaceX for rocket launches.

    Throughout this capstone project, you will gain firsthand experience of the challenges data scientists encounter when handling real-world datasets. Your role will mirror that of a Data Scientist within a startup striving to compete with SpaceX. This journey will encompass the complete Data Science methodology, including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, model evaluation, and presenting findings to stakeholders. Your primary task involves predicting the success of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first stage landing.

### Problem Description in the Project

    The problem at hand revolves around predicting the success of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage landing for SpaceX launches. This prediction holds immense value as it directly impacts the cost of each launch. SpaceX's unique ability to reuse the first stage significantly reduces their launch expenses compared to other providers. By accurately forecasting the likelihood of a successful landing, the cost estimation for a launch can be refined. This predictive insight becomes a strategic advantage for a competing startup, enabling them to make more informed and competitive bids when challenging SpaceX in the rocket launch market.
